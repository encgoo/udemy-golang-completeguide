Note, class note are given as [diagrams](https://github.com/StephenGrider/GoCasts/tree/master/diagrams). 

Also note that we are going to put multiple projects into a vscode workspace here. So do this from command line in this folder
```bash
go work init
go work use cards
go work use _other_projct_
....

```
NOTE: Need to create the module `go mod init cards` before `go work use cards`. If just create a folder cards and then `go work use cards`, it won't add. 

## Section 1
All go packages are listed in this [page](https://golang.org/pkg). These are official packages?

## Miscs
The vs code debugger uses Xcode debugger behind the scene. If Xcode is not working, then vs code debugger won't work.
